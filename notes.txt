will need to store the data in a cookie i think and pass to new page

12-5 json is undefined in the getsurveybyid method check that out

ok so trying to clear the buttons and choices when you go to your specific survey but the nothing is not working...

12/31 ok so merged in my branch to main
now im trying to figure out the #/#survey hash thing, working in index.js

1/7 added the forward and back buttons, although it does not go all the way back home, maybe because I need to add a render template?

1/11 this popstate state is not being passed over for some reason from home
after creating the curvey 'survey test' does get passed!

1/16/21 check out the video gaur associates hash in url explained, so if you change the href with a hash??

1/25/21 have to remove the html elements from index.html

1/27/21
ok so we need the buttons to come along with the ride too on the home page

1/29/21 ok so now the mysurveys renders without the input choices, that looks good, but the input choices stay behind at other pages as well, try to use the same tactic on those pages with the remove method

2/2 ok so I got the template to render based on if you fill out a 3 or 4 survey. now need to fire an event to record the response

2/3/21 ok so seleting a choice from the survey is getting the event to fire

2/4/21 ok so I can get the result from the choice click, now need to somehow feed it back into the put request

2/5/21 so doing a get request for the survey and then editing it, next have to fix the fetch in the recording function, right direction keep going

2/6/21 editing back end code to handle checking what attribute changed then just add to that

2/7/21 so it looks like on initial tests, the survey is correctly updating with the selection you make!

2/11/21 conditional rendering for my surveys works decent, rendering nothing for choice 4, shoudl make these surveys clickable to then go and record your response?
